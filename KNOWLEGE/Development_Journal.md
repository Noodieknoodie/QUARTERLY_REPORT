# Hohimer Report Generator - Project Roadmap

## Phase 1: Excel Data Extraction
- [x] Parse Excel workbook with investment model data
- [x] Extract model metadata (As Of Date, Portfolio, etc.)
- [x] Extract model commentary text
- [x] Extract Top 10 holdings with weights
- [x] Extract Regional Allocations
- [x] Extract Metrics (Portfolio vs Benchmark)
- [x] Extract Sector breakdowns
- [x] Extract Securities Added/Removed
- [x] Format numbers (show decimals only when needed)
- [x] Create reliable error handling

## Phase 2: Report Template Creation
- [ ] Create base Handlebars template structure
- [ ] Implement header and footer partials
- [ ] Design cover page template
- [ ] Design index page template
- [ ] Create model-specific page templates (Core, Growth, etc.)
- [ ] Add CSS styling for print formatting

## Phase 3: PDF Generation
- [ ] Set up Puppeteer for HTML to PDF conversion
- [ ] Configure proper page sizing and margins
- [ ] Implement header/footer on all pages
- [ ] Generate complete multi-page PDF report
- [ ] Save output to designated directory

## Phase 4: Integration & Usability
- [ ] Create simple command-line interface
- [ ] Add configuration options (input/output paths)
- [ ] Add basic error handling and logging
- [ ] Create simple documentation
- [ ] Test with various Excel files

NEXT 



heres the plan.


1. look at my full mockup. use this as your foundation.
2. decide what sort of style sheets or css should be used for ALL sheets. what can you say, with confidence, will be gloabal? ill take your lead
3. what sort of stuff will be specific to growth? (ps "core" will have the exact same template as "growth", so... maybe we can modularlize it in that sense"
4. basically, how are you going to take this mockup, and refractor it into this app so that it takes the ACTUAL data, injects it into the exact same spots, styles it the same way, and results a literaly exact same end result for all intents and purposes (assuming the data is the same). is there anything in the mockup data wise that our current excel data gathering doesnt contain?
5. remember, this is setting the stage for the other pages. even though you dont know everything about the other pages yet in terms of layout, you are setting up the foundation for structure here. so think about it. dont over engineer stuff, just make it clean and reliable. we can always break it down further or refracter further down the road, so for now stick to what you feel confident in doing in terms of structuring the code side of things for this. 


at the end of the day:


YOUR JOB IS TO STUDY THIS MOCKUP AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO REPLICATE IT LITERALLY IDENTICALLY WITHOUT OUR ACTUAL SYSTEM.

PLEASE RESPOND BY:


1. reading the code attached
2. looking at the current code base from the outside in deeply. deep study
3. decide if the current structure is set up to support the goal
4. provide your gameplan
5. ask permission to proceed.
6. stop here for now.

remember, the mockup is completely hardcoded and standalone. its perfect for showing you the what, where, and why.
